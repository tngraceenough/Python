# Conditional Statements:

# if some condition is true: (if true will only run this if line)
#  do something

# elif some other condition is true: ( if other thing was not true)
#  do something 
# else:
#     do something
# need only 1 else as catch all but can have several elifs
# Indentation matters
# Syntax matters (:)
