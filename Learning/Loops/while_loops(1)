# While Loops
# function like if statements but execute code continuously until it breaks once
# don't know when loop to be met 
# Most programs run on a loop

x_pos = 0
end_pos = 5

#while <condition>:
#    x_pos += 1

while x_pos < end_pos:
    x_pos += 1
    print(x_pos)
print("You've reached the end!")
