# Loops

# What are loops?
## - provide a way to automate code to run multiple times
## - run codes multiple times even though run it once
## - runs until it meets a breaking condition

# While Loops
## - function like if statements but execute code continuously until it breaks once
## - don't know when loop to be met 


# For loops
> ## Run a set number of times with specific times and endpoints
## - set start value, end value and iterator
## - often used with ranges and lists
## - easier to control; little more restrictive than while loops
## - know how many times to run it - range or list 
## - all for loops can be converted to while loops but not all while loops can be for loops
