# Classes and Objects
## Objects = entity with state, properties and behavior; modelled after real life objects
## Classes = implementations of objects; describes how object should run while object does the running; behavior represented by functions/methods; special initializer fucntion to set up initial state (set variable value)
## Class acts as blueprint for an object, initializer creates instance of classes/objects
# Inheritance = write code once and use inheriatnce to rewrite it; use inheritance for 2 similar classes; one class inherit everything from other but add its own stuff;subclass( more specific) inherit from superclass (generic)
# Static variables and functions = static variables/functions hold values across all instances of the class;
