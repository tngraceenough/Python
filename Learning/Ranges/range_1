# Ranges
# exist in for loops
# immutable sequence of data that is used with for loops


# Range examples

# range(7) gives integers from 0 to 6

# range(1,8) gives integers from 1 to 7

# range(1,8, 2) gives odd integers from 1 to 8. 3rd number is step - how many to skip

# range(7,0, -1) gives integers from 7 to 1. 3rd number is step - how many to skip. Negative in this case


# List 1 to 9
r = range(0, 10)
list(r)


# List even numbers from 0 to 8
r = range(0, 10, 2)
list(r)



# List odd numbers form 1 to 9
r = range(1, 10, 2)
list(r)
